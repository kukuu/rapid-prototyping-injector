# Rapid Prototyping Injector - RPI

Integration B2C and B2B SaaS Platforms for rapid prototyping and building PoCs. A useful tool for Technology Consultants working with multiple Clients to derive requirements, goals, vision and growth for the business.

## Mission
We are in to disrupt UCD and UDD markets with credible options/alternatives, value and show how different user-generated outputs can be integrated synchronously into a one-stop-eCommerce storefront, stay focused and harness increased productivity and revenue. 

Rapid Prototyping Injector is about building markets for this innovation to grow into. A great product like Rapid Prototyping Injector will not succeed without a strong customer base, adequate regulation, access to data, skills and capital. The reason we are building to serve B2C and B2B business platforms. 

## What is Rapid Prototyping Injector?
- It is an integrated business, sales and marketing tool for rapid templating: POCs and Prototyping. The Frontend is a SaaS interface configured to allow clients to send their products and services via our Cloud API and run a trading, operational platform to serve  customers.
- RPI is a Microservices Architecture. MSA is a software architectural style that structures the application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. RPI is a service that focuses on a specific business capability and operates as a separate process or container - as an Uploader for rapid prototyping.
- As a microservice RPI follows the principle of Bounded Context from Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This allows software development teams to align their services with specific business requirements and maintain better separation of concerns.
- Provides a dedicated Container Wrapper for customer applications and services.
- As a PWA, Rapid Prototyping Injector offers a range of benefits, including improved user engagement, and broader reach across devices and platforms.
- As a microservice, RPI can interact with other services through well-defined APIs, either through synchronous RESTful APIs, messaging protocols like RabbitMQ, or event-driven architectures like Apache Kafka. This loose coupling enables flexibility and allows services to evolve independently.
- It automatically updates in the background, ensuring that users always have the latest version without needing to manually update or visit an app store.
- Rapid Prototyping Injector is fast performant and is designed to load quickly and provide a smooth and responsive user experience. It employs techniques like caching, prefetching, and lazy loading to optimize performance.
- It has offline capabilities and can function even when there is no internet connection, thanks to its caching mechanisms enabled by service workers. This allows users to access content and perform certain tasks offline.
- As a microservice RPI takes a Polyglot Approach to integration with other services: Allows the use of different technologies, programming languages, and databases suitable for each service's specific needs. This enables teams to choose the most appropriate technology stack for each service, promoting flexibility and innovation.
- Adoption of microservice architecture for RPI makes it scalability and resilient: MSA enables horizontal scaling of individual services, which can be beneficial in handling variable workloads. Additionally, failures in one service do not affect the entire system, promoting resilience and fault isolation.
- RPI is built to easily integrate with DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices. Built as an MSA it aligns well with DevOps practices and continuous delivery pipelines, as they enable frequent deployments, testing, and monitoring of individual services without impacting the entire application.

#### Note!
Microservices Architecture is commonly used in complex and scalable applications where modularity, scalability, and flexibility are essential. However, it also introduces challenges such as managing service interactions, ensuring data consistency across services, and addressing distributed system complexities. Careful design, proper communication mechanisms, and effective monitoring and observability practices are crucial for successful implementation of a Microservices Architecture.
